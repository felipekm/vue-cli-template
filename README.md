# vue-pwa-boilerplate

> A full-featured [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) template with webpack, hot-reload, lint-on-save, unit testing & css extraction.

## Documentation

- This template builds on top of the main webpack template, so please refer to the [webpack template docs](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack).

- Check out the [official Vue.js guide](http://vuejs.org/guide/) for general information about Vue that is not specific to this template.

## Usage

This is a project template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli). **It is recommended to use npm 3+ or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) for a more efficient dependency tree.**

``` bash
$ npm install -g vue-cli
$ vue init plingbr/vue-cli-template my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
